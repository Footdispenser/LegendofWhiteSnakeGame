Sister what happened?

[Bai Suzhen] 
I...I let my guard down, Xu Xian gave me Realgar Wine, and I transformed.

[Xiao Qing]
What! How did he find out!

[Bai Suzhen] 
That monk... he probably gave it to him.

[Xiao Qing]

[Xiao Qing]
We have to leave now, you have been exposed. The Heavens are going to come after us!

[Bai Suzhen]

[Bai Suzhen] 
No.

[Xiao Qing]

[Xiao Qing]
Give it up sis. Know that he knows your a snake, he will NEVER accept you.

[Bai Suzhen]

[Xiao Qing]
You have no more reason to stay here sis.

[Xiao Qing]
Lets hurry and leave before we get caught by the Heavens and DIE!

[Bai Suzhen]

[Xiao Qing]
What are we going to do now. 

[Bai Suzhen] 
Xiao Qing, I'll go find him. Once he...once we talk again he'll understand.

[Xiao Qing]
What if he doesn't accept you. You will just be walking to your death.

[Bai Suzhen] 
It's a risk I am willing to take.

[Xiao Qing]

[Xiao Qing]
It's too dangerous sis. You are pregnant.

[Bai Suzhen] 
No this is something I have to do.

[Xiao Qing]

[Xiao Qing]
Alright...
